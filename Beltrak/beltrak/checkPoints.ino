/*this function was originaly used to check the position of the points but it turned out
to cause multiple errors and so was removed and replaced with code that simply switched 
the points without remembering their position*/

//  {
//    if (pointState[i] != pointSwitch[i]) //if the state doesent match what it should be

//      setPoint(pointSwitch[i], i); //move the points
//      pointState[i] = pointSwitch[i]; //change the state
